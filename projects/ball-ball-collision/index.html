                <p>I was slowing myself down by thinking of how I could optimise the ball-ball collision detection before even trying to make a simple one. I would have bogged myself with quad-trees and it's construction, which wouldn't have been un-useful, but I would not know how much useful it was to have that optimisation without having made an unoptimised version.</p>

                <p>So here I go, starting to design a ball-ball collision simulator.</p>

                <p>It is an add-on to the bouncing balls, except that this times each ball would interact with eachother.</p>

                <p>I plan to be as accurate as I can in my physics (newtonianly speaking of-course).</p>

                <p>I would have a class called ball which would store the following properties:<br>
                &ThickSpace;- radius<br>
                &ThickSpace;- position<br>
                &ThickSpace;- mass<br>
                &ThickSpace;- velocity<br></p>    
                
                <p>Acceleration is seen as a property from the external - the system, following Newton's first law.</p>

                <p>For this version I would consider the collison with the borders of the canvas as a system event. The whole reason why I had gone about learning about convex polygon collision detection was to come up with a general way to handle them. I guess for now I would be postponing that.</p>

                <p>This time I would also consider time. In the earlier simulations, time was whatever requestAnimationFrame decided. However I had noticed that this led to non-uniformity in the frame-rate, especially in my <a href="../bouncing-balls/">"bouncing balls"</a> project. The animation was way too fast on mobile phones as compared to the PC browser.</p>
