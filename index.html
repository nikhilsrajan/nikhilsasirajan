        <h2>about me</h2>
        <!-- <div class="six columns subhead">Who I am. What is going on here.</div> -->
        </div>
        <p>I am a software developer at CFD company&ndash;primarily working on C++ &amp; Python, making tools for geometry analysis, and scripts for testing the company product. I have however recently started dwelling into JavaScript and thought a GitHub page such as this would be useful to document and showcase my learnings.</p>

        <p>I was born in <a href="#" target="_blank">Kerala</a>, spent childhood in <a href="#" target="_blank">Mumbai</a>, adolescence in <a href="#" target="_blank">Kuwait</a>, did my undergraduation in <a href="#" target="_blank">Mandi</a>, graduation in <a href="#" target="_blank">Chennai</a>, and now am working in <a href="#" target="_blank">Bengaluru</a>. In short, my answer to where I am from is not gonna be.</p>
        
        <p>Did my bachelors in mechanical engineering, and masters in Mathematics &amp; Computing, but over the 6 years of college I found myself returning to computer programming&ndash;a skill I had first learnt in my high school. At this point in life I am closer than I have ever been, hoping to only learn more and more.</p>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p>During this period of COVID-19 quarantine, I have decided that I would learn web-developement as much as I can, starting from HTML, CSS, and most importantly and very specifically JavaScript. I place the emphasis that I have on JS mainly since I have always wanted to be able to visually demonstrate physics without breaking my head over rendering. During undergraduation <a href="#" target="_blank">a very clever friend of mine</a> used it to demonstrate trees for his datastructures assignment. But is is only now that I have got around learning it.</p>

        <p>So, without further ado, I will list out the things I have learnt and am learning.</p>

        <p>Oh, btw, this page that I have made for myself is stolen from <a href="https://nik.org/" target="_blank">Nik PapiÄ‡</a>.</p>
